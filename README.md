My name is Yohan and I'm currently studying mechanical engineering at the [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/) in France.

I'm mostly using python and c++ to help me achieve various projects which are either personal, school related or professional. 

I'm sharing some projects in the hope that it will help or interest somebody at some point ! Enjoy ðŸ˜‰ !
